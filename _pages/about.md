Hi, I‚Äôm Lang Cheng, currently pursuing a BA in Education Studies at UCL. My research focuses on Learning Analytics, Multimodel Learning Analytics, AI in Education, and Human‚ÄìTechnology Interaction, with a particular interest in how immersive technologies and AI-driven tools can enhance collaboration, motivation, and equity in learning and helping teachers.

I have taken part in multiple international research projects. At The University of Hong Kong (HKU), I joined Professor Hu Xiao's group and contributed to studies on VR/AR-based learning analytics in both secondary and primary schools. My work involved guiding students to create VR stories, designing mixed-method studies, and conducting advanced data analysis (quantitative statistics, NLP-based text mining, and topic modeling). Some of these findings have already been presented at CSCL 2025 and JCDL 2025. I am also working on Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA) projects to explore how teachers use learning analytics platforms in practice. During my summer research at UCL‚Äôs **EPSURF**, I joined Professor Jessica Ringrose's group and took part in an interdisciplinary study on adolescent mobile-phone policies, leading the literature review and qualitative data analysis (including MCDA multimodal discourse analysis and topic modelling). I carried out a comparative analysis of student samples from two schools, revealing social-class differences in attitudes toward phone use and in perceptions of policy enforcement.

Beyond research, I gained hands-on product and analytical experience. At iFLYTEK, I worked on AI product management and user behaviour analytics, identifying teachers‚Äô needs in lesson planning and optimising product functions. In the UK, I joined the charity Archives of IT (AIT), where I co-authored articles and communication pieces after its 2025 Forum, strengthening my skills in bridging expert knowledge with public engagement.

I continuously expand my technical foundation through advanced study programs, including Computational Social Science (X Academy Summer School) and Mathematics for Machine Learning (UCL Summer School). These programs equipped me with statistical, machine learning, and NLP methods that directly support my research in education.

Outside academia, I‚Äôm passionate about football, baseball, and basketball, which keep me energised, collaborative, and competitive both on and off the field.
